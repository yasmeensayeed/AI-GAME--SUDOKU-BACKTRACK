## Introduction

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. This project provides an AI-based approach to solve Sudoku puzzles using two different algorithms: backtracking and genetic algorithms.

## Features

- **Backtracking Solver:** A classic approach to solving Sudoku puzzles through depth-first search and constraint propagation.
- **Genetic Algorithm Solver:** An evolutionary algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for inputting Sudoku puzzles and viewing solutions.
- **Customizable:** Modify parameters and constraints for the genetic algorithm to explore different solution strategies.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy


from sudoku_solver import SudokuSolver

puzzle = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

solver = SudokuSolver()
solution = solver.solve_with_backtracking(puzzle)
print(solution)
